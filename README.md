);

```

### 5. Least Selling Product of Each Country (Annual)
```sql
WITH product_rank AS (

        SUM(sl.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY st.country, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sl.sale_date) ORDER BY SUM(sl.quantity) DESC) AS rank
    FROM
        stores st
    JOIN sales sl ON st.store_id = sl.store_id
    JOIN products p ON p.product_id = sl.product_id

WHERE w.claim_date - s.sale_date <= 180;


```

### 7. Monthly Running Total of Sales for Each Store

    SELECT
        s.store_id,

SELECT 
    store_id,
    month,
    year,
